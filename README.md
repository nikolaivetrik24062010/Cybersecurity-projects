# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
Here I showcase hands-on projects built to strengthen my skills in **SOC analysis, threat hunting, vulnerability scanning, and cloud security**.  

Each folder contains a separate project with its own documentation (`README.md`).

## 📂 Projects

🔹 [**SOC Lab**](SOC-Lab/README.md)  
Simulated Security Operations Center environment using SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh). Includes log collection, alerting, and incident response playbooks.

🔹 [**Vulnerability Scanning**](Vulnerability-Scanning/README.md)  
Scanning and assessing systems using **Nmap, OpenVAS, Nessus, and Nikto**. Includes remediation reporting.

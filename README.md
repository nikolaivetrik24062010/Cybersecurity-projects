Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
Here I showcase hands-on projects built to strengthen my skills in **SOC analysis, threat hunting, vulnerability scanning, and cloud security**.  

Each folder contains a separate project with its own documentation (`README.md`).

---

## 📂 Projects

🔹 [**SOC Lab**](SOC-Lab/README.md)  
Simulated Security Operations Center environment using SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh). Includes log collection, alerting, and incident response playbooks.

🔹 [**Vulnerability Scanning**](Vulnerability-Scanning/README.md)  
Scanning and assessing systems using **Nmap, OpenVAS, Nessus, and Nikto**. Includes remediation reporting.

🔹 [**Threat Hunting**](Threat-Hunting/README.md)  
Practical hunting scenarios with SIEM queries, Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

🔹 [**Cloud Security**](Cloud-Security/README.md)  
Projects on **AWS security**: IAM best practices, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and cloud vulnerability scanning.

- Cloud security monitoring with AWS IAM, CloudTrail, GuardDuty  
- Automation with Linux and Python  

---

## 🎯 Target Roles
This portfolio demonstrates skills relevant for:

- **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst (Entry-Level)** – focus on monitoring, detection, and incident response  
- **Security Engineer (Mid-Level)** – building and securing systems, automating processes  
- **Cloud Security Engineer (Future Goal)** – securing cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)

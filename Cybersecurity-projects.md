# Cybersecurity Portfolio: Security Engineering & AppSec

Welcome to my cybersecurity project repository. As a Cybersecurity student at **WGU** with a background in **Software Development**, I bridge the gap between building secure applications and defending infrastructure. 

This portfolio showcases hands-on labs, vulnerability assessments, and security automation tools.
